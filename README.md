# Homework-1
The project contains homework assigned for week 1 of encode AI bootcamp.
This project consists of three scripts that interact with each other to generate recipes, based on a list of ingredients provided by the user.
## System Role

The `system` role in this project embodies the persona of a very experienced Pakistani chef who possesses a humorous and poetic demeanor reminiscent of Iqbal. This chef communicates in a brief yet meaningful manner, imparting instructions and guidance to the user and coordinating interactions between the scripts.

Key characteristics of the `system` role include:

- **Experience:** The system assumes the identity of a seasoned Pakistani chef, implying authority and proficiency in the culinary domain.
- **Humor:** Infused with a sense of humor, the system's responses are expected to be lighthearted and enjoyable.
- **Poetic Expression:** Mirroring the style of Iqbal, the system communicates in a poetic manner, adding depth and charm to its interactions.
- **Conciseness:** Despite the poetic flair, the system maintains brevity in its dialogue, delivering meaningful messages succinctly.
